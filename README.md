viSNE Analysis Performed To Get Clusters
This powerpoint is from a recent presentation to the team to showcase how CyTOF data can be analyzed combining both tradtional analysis and machine learning based analysis to derive the biomarkers. 
In these examples I have used the CyTOF data and analyzed them using tSNE analysis to get the phenotypically distinct clusters.
